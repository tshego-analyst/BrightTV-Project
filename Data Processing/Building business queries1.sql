 Updated SA demographics for 2016:

African/Black — 80.7%
Coloured — 8.8%
Indian/Asian — 2.5%
White — 8.1%

 Step 1 — Get total viewership:
4176 + 1564 + 1431 + 1232 + 1011 + 96 + 5 = 9,515 total views
Step 2 — Calculate each race's viewership percentage:

Black: 4176 ÷ 9515 × 100 = 43.9% of viewership
Indian Asian: 1431 ÷ 9515 × 100 = 15% of viewership

Step 3 — Compare to population percentage:
Race      Population %Viewership %Difference
Black     80.7% 43.9%     -36.8% (red)
Coloured    8.8%  16.4%+   7.6% (Green)
Indian Asian  2.5%  15%+   12.5% (Green)
White         8.1%  12.9%     +4.8% (Green)


If viewership % > population % → Overrepresented (Green)
If viewership % < population % → Underrepresented (Red)
If viewership % ≈ population % → Proportional (Good)

Black — 80.7% of population, 44% of viewership → underrepresented 
Coloured — 8.8% of population, 16% of viewership → overrepresented 
Indian Asian — 2.5% of population, 15% of viewership → massively overrepresented 
White — 8.1% of population, 13% of viewership → overrepresented 

In conclusion

Indian Asian viewers are our most engaged demographic relative to their population size,
presenting an opportunity to further invest in content targeting this group. 
Despite being 81% of the population, Black viewers are underrepresented in our viewership, 
suggesting untapped growth potential in this demographic.

Black content correlation:
-->High Black viewership + Channel O, Trace TV, MK, Africa Magic dominating = data is consistent and valid!
Female viewership theory busted:
--> E! Entertainment and Vuzu (female targeted) have LOW views = females are likely NOT using partners accounts after all!
 Your earlier theory was self-corrected with data 
Low E! and Vuzu viewership doesn't mean females aren't watching
It could mean females who DO watch prefer other content not traditionally labelled as "female"
Maybe female viewers are watching sports, music or news too!

Senior Citizens:
--> CNN viewership could represent the small senior citizen audience — news content appeals to older demographics!
M-Net:

Insights 
"Contrary to expectations, female viewers on BrightTV gravitate towards Africa Magic, 
Trace TV and Cartoon Network rather than traditionally female targeted content like E! Entertainment and Vuzu. 
This suggests BrightTV's female audience has diverse content preferences that don't align with traditional gender content stereotypes

Reccomendation:
Content investment decisions should be based on actual viewing data rather than traditional gender content assumptions.

Indian Asian:

-->ICC Cricket World Cup is their #1 channel — cultural affinity with cricket confirmed! 🏏
Their overrepresentation in viewership now makes even more sense!

Black viewers:

--> Channel O, Africa Magic and Trace — music and culture driven 🎵
--> Also present in sports — SuperSport Live Events at position 4

Sports breakdown:

--> Coloured and White viewers gravitate heavily towards SuperSport
--> Black viewers surprisingly NOT the top sports watchers — Indian Asian and Coloured lead there!

The absence of football content on BrightTV may be contributing to the underrepresentation of Black viewers in sports viewership. 
Given that football is the most popular sport among Black South Africans who represent 80.7% of the population,
 adding a dedicated football channel could significantly grow viewership among this demographic

 During Q1 2016, sports content was heavily cricket dominated. A dedicated football channel or
  more football content could attract the large Black South African demographic who are underrepresented in sports viewership.
